<h1>Brute-Force SSH Credentials</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Project consists of a brute force attack to get access to a remote host. This project has served to a way of highlighting the importance of owning a strong password. We will be exploring different ways of implementing brute force attack against combinations of usernames and passwords on open SSH ports.
<br />

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Kali Linux</b>

<h2>Program walk-through:</h2>

<p align="center">
Metasploit version (Nmap scan): <br/>
  
  - <b>First we have to discover and determine which of our devices on the network might have an SSH port open</b>
  - <b>We will be starting with getting the network range</b>
  - <b>This command filteres the information to only displaying the phrases that contain the word inet </b>

<br />
  
  - <b>We discovered that our IP address is 10.0.2.15 </b>
  - <b>To get the network range we will be executing the following command </b>
  - <b>The network range is 10.0.2.0/24</b>

<br />
  
  - <b>The reason why we need this for our nmap scan is because it allows us to scan every device within the network</b>
  - <b>The command within the picture bellow will be showing information about the SSH port(port 22) that are open only as we are only interested in the open ports</b>

<br />
  
  - <b>Because our port 22 is closed, we will have to make it listen</b>
  - <b>Fist install openssh-server</b>
  - <b>Then access the sshd_config file within the /etc/ssh directory</b>

<br />
 
  - <b>In this file you can also assign the ssh port to another port (for security purposes)</b>

<br />
  
  - <b>To open the port just run the command service ssh start and now we can see that the port 22 is now open for our IP</b>

<br />
  
  - <b>Nmap can allow scripting as well and nmap can be used as an attack tool and not only as a scanning tool</b>
  - <b>Now we will be creating a list of users and passwords that will be stored on the Desktop</b>

<br />
    
  - <b>Now we are starting the metasploit (because we are using kali, it should be already installed)</b>
  - <b>This will allow us to brute force SSH</b>

<br />
    
  - <b>Once we are up and running metasploit, perform a ssh search and then use then you can manually search for the file that you want to use (should be the directory that leads to ssh_login) and we will be directed into the auxiliary scanner </b>

<br />
      
  - <b>Those are all the things that we can set up our metasploit to do before deploying the payload, however some of them are not actually required, but the ones that are, needs to be filled in before moving ahead</b>

<br />
        
  - <b>Here we are setting the rhosts to the IP address of our target</b>
  - <b>The reason why we are setting stop_on_success to true is that after finding the valid credentials, it will stop seaching</b>

<br />
          
  - <b>Then set the user_file to users.txt</b>
  - <b>Same for the password.txt</b>
  - <b>Then we would like to see all the attemps so we will be setting the verbose to true</b>

<br />
            
  - <b>Now that we set it up, we can run it</b>

<br />
              
  - <b>It can be noticed in the result that an SSH session has opened and we can start now attacking it</b>
